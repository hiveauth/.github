# Welcome to HiveAuth contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

# Please Read

Please read these instructions before submitting issues to the Hive GitHub repository.
The issue tracker is for bugs and specific implementation discussion **only**. It should not be used for other purposes, as described below.

## Bug Reports

If there is an existing feature that is not working correctly, or a glitch in the protocol that is impacting services behaviour - please open an issue.
Include as much relevant information as you can, including screen shots or log output when applicable, and steps to reproduce the issue.

## Enhancement Suggestions

Do **not** use the issue tracker to suggest enhancements or improvements.
The best place for these discussions is on Discord.

## Duplicate Issues

Please do a keyword search to see if there is already an existing issue before opening a new one.

## Pull Requests

Anybody in the community is welcome and encouraged to submit pull requests with any desired changes!

Requests to make changes that include working, tested pull requests jump to the top of the queue. There is not a guarantee that all functionality submitted as a PR will be accepted and merged, however.
